## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

Requirements Document (referred to as RD) 1.0, highlights the functionality of Dimspace, an easy to use online web application for the delivery UVic course content. Students at UVic find the currently in use "Brightspace" web app to be slow and difficult to use, so a new intuitive software solution is needed to streamline the online course delivery process.

### 1.2 Project Scope

The scope of this project is to alleviate the confusing layout of Brightspace, and to cut down on the amount of time it takes for students to find lecture slides, assignment deadlines, and grades for their courses. As the majority of courses at UVic provide content online, a system with an easier to use interface would greatly cut down on student confusion. The new web app will similarly host all course content, grades, and deadlines as the current service. It is yet to be determined if migration of existing course data to a new database would be required, or the current database can be repurposed.

#### 3.2.1 Description and Priority

On any of their courses, instructors may post notes that are visible to students. These notes can
contain arbitrary attachment files (e.g. PDF lecture slides, Excel spreadsheets, etc). Additionally,
some of these notes can be designated as Assignment notes. Students may upload their own files to
these assignment notes, and professors can view everything that each student uploaded, and respond
to each of these submissions with grades and feedback. Students can only view the files they have
submitted and the grades they received on their own work (students can't see each others submissions
or grades).
