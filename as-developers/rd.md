## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

Requirements Document (referred to as RD) 1.0, highlights the functionality of Dimspace, an easy to use online web application for the delivery UVic course content. Students at UVic find the LMS that is currently in use (Brightspace) to be slow and difficult to use, so a new intuitive software solution is needed to streamline the online course delivery process.

### 1.2 Project Scope

The scope of this project is to alleviate the confusing layout of Brightspace, and to cut down on the amount of time it takes for students to find lecture slides, assignment deadlines, and grades for their courses. As the majority of courses at UVic provide content online, a system with an easier to use interface would greatly cut down on student confusion. The new web app will similarly host all course content, grades, and deadlines as the current service. It is yet to be determined if migration of existing course data to a new database would be required, or the current database can be repurposed.

### 1.4 Overview

## 2 Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

The centralized course delivery system to be developed will serve as a replacement for the current Brightspace system at UVic. The perspective for this system is outlined below:

- The system will replace Brightspace for managing course grades, schedules, assignments, lecture videos and pdfs, and other course deliverables.
- The system will be accessed by teachers and students on a variety of electronic devices via their netlink ID and password on a single centralized webapp.

### 2.2 Product Features

The system will serve as a centralized platform for teachers to deliver course content and to collect assignment submissions from students. The system will have a dedicated page for each course a student is registered in. These pages will display lecture slides and assignments in reverse chronological order for ease of navigation.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
There will be two types of users using this system: the student and instructor. The student class will have view-only permissions for most of the objects except for uploading assignments. The instructor class will be able to view and modify the objects. 

#### 2.3.1 Student Users
Student users can view all the objects that have been granted the access from the instructor user. In addition, a student user can upload and change the files under the 'Assignment' tab under the Course Content section within the starting and ending time assigned by the instructor class. 

#### 2.3.2 Instructor Users
Instructor users will have the permission to modify all the objects. They will be able to upload files under the Course Content section and assign a starting and ending date to each object under the section. They will also be able to input grade numbers under the Grade section and assign a formula of how the weight achieved is automatically calculated. 

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- Hardware platform: The system can be accessed using common web browser apps on both PC's and portable devices. The web browser apps need to support basic HTML and JavaScript extensions.
- Operating system and version: The system need to be accessible on the following operating systems: Windows, Mac OS, and Linux/Unix.
 
### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints

_Hardware constraints_

Students generally have access to relatively recent hardware and modern browsers, so support for older browsers such as
Internet Explorer is not necessary. Since we will rely on cloud services for hosting, we will not consider hardware
requirements—this responsibility will be left to the cloud provider.

_Interaction with Third-Party Applications_

The software may make use of third-party software libraries for development purposes as long as there is no concern of
major security issues. Otherwise, the webapp will obviously interact with third-party browsers, as is consistent with
the reality of frontend web development. However, some browser extensions that may cause safety issues will not be allowed to interact with. 

_System Maintenance_

The vendor assures that the system will be maintained in good working order so that neither students nor instructors have
issues with accessing and using the system normally. Additionally, regular maintenance will be performed in a manner that
does not cause major disruptions. When the system needs to be taken offline for a noticeable amount of time, this will be
done during late-night hours.

### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies

#### 2.6.1 Assumptions

_Availability of Cloud Computing and Storage_

The application will be designed and developed with cloud computing in mind, and additionally the responsibility of
provisioning and maintaining physical hardware will be offloaded to a cloud vendor. Should requirements change and cloud
compute/storage not be available, time and cost estimates will change.

_Internet Connection_

In order for the service to function correctly, it must remain connected to the Internet to be available to students
and instructors. Additionally, the assumption is made that all users also have access to the Internet—it'll be a basic
requirement for accessing the application.

_Scheduling_

It is assumed that a reasonable schedule for the completion of this project will be shared in the near future.

#### 2.6.2 Dependencies

_Third-Party Dependencies_

Development efforts will make use of third-party libraries—as is common in the field of software development—in order to
most efficiently develop robust and maintainable code. This is a reasonable dependency, and only well-established and
widely-used software libraries will be depended upon.

## 3 System Features

### 3.1 Courses

#### 3.1.1 Description and Priority

There are two main account types for the courses section, students and instructors. A student account will be able to view and access course content for only courses that they are registered in. The homepage consists of a catalogue of courses that the student has registered in. The instructors account will only have access to courses that they own and will be able to control what the students have access to with-in their own course. They will also have a similar homepage which displays a catalogue of courses which they own. This feature is of **high priority**.
#### 3.1.2 Functional Requirements

REQ-1-1: Students' homepages should show exactly the courses that they are registered in, and instructors' homepages should show exactly the courses that they administer

REQ-1-2: Each course must display the course name, course number, and the section that the student belongs to

REQ-1-3: If a course is dropped by a student, they can no longer view that course on their homepage catalogue

### 3.2 Course Content

#### 3.2.1 Description and Priority

On any of their courses, instructors may post notes that are visible to students. These notes can
contain arbitrary attachment files (e.g. PDF lecture slides, Excel spreadsheets, etc). Additionally,
some of these notes can be designated as Assignment notes. Students may upload their own files to
these assignment notes, and professors can view everything that each student uploaded, and respond
to each of these submissions with grades and feedback. Students can only view the files they have
submitted and the grades they received on their own work (students can't see each other's submissions
or grades). This feature is of **high priority**.

#### 3.2.2 Functional Requirements

REQ-2-1: Instructors may post notes (discrete bulletin style messages) to their course pages.

REQ-2-2: Instructors may add arbitrary file attachments to these notes that may be viewed and
downloaded by students

REQ-2-3: Students see all notes that instructors post on course pages in reverse chronological
order on the respective course page

REQ-2-4: Instructors may designate specific notes to accept assignment submissions. Students can upload
files to these assignment notes, which are in turn visible to the instructor. These submissions
are visible only to the student who uploaded them, and the instructor.

REQ-2-5: Instructors may assign grades (decimal number from 0.0 to 100.0) to each student's submission,
which the student can see in the place where they submitted their assignment. Instructors will be able to assign a grade over 100.0 if needed. 

REQ-2-6: Instructors may optionally set a due date for assignments, after which students cannot
submit anything further.

### 3.3 Grades

#### 3.3.1 Description and Priority
This feature must allow the user to see the grade number for all the items that have been assigned a grade by the instructor. When the 'Grade' tab is clicked, all the graded items will be presented using a spreadsheet style. Each item should have the following information: item name, grade, and weight achieved. In addition, a instructor user should have permission to input a grade number for an item, and system will automatically calculate the weight achieved, but a student user will only have the permission to view the items that have already been assigned a grade by the instructor. This feature is of **high priority**.

#### 3.3.2 Functional Requirements
REQ-3-1: Students see all the graded items' item names, grades and weights achieved on one page in chronological order on the 'Grades' page. 

REQ-3-2: Instructors can input grade number (decimal number from 0.0 to 100.0) in each item.

REQ-3-3: The system can calculate the weight achieved automatically based on a formula provided by the instructor.

### 3.4 Self-adaptation

#### 3.4.1 Description and Priority

The system should adapt to patterns it observes in its users' behaviour in order to make their use
of the software more convenient. It should provide quick links to places within the site (notes,
assignments, other pages) that users access either often, or recently. ("Frecently") Additionally,
the system should continually test at what times users are most receptive to notifications about
upcoming deadlines, and adjust email notifications to be sent at times that users open them most
reliably.

#### 3.4.2 Functional Requirements

REQ-4-1: The user's homepage should have a list of links generated based on what they visit both
frequently and recently, based on some reasonable implementation of the "frequency" algorithm.

REQ-4-2: Users should be reminded of upcoming deadlines by email, and the system should keep track
of what email notification times are most likely to correlate with system interaction shortly after
delivery. Then, notification delivery times should be tuned closer to these times.

### 3.5 User Authentication

#### 3.5.1 Description and Priority

With different user types having access to the system, the system needs to have an authentication layer to prevent unauthorized access to the accounts. The authentication layer will include a MFA system that links an account to a cell phone number. The cell phone number will be unique to that account and can not be used for other account profiles. When attempting to log in on a new device, a text message will be sent to that unique cell phone number with a security code that must be entered before the user can log into the account. To avoid redundancy, the user will have the option to "Trust This Device" for 30 days. When a user goes through the MFA process on a new device, they will be granted an option to avoid using the MFA on that specific device only for 30 days so they do not need to go through this every time they log in. Users can have multiple trusted devices. This feature is of **high priority**. 

#### 3.5.2 Functional Requirements

REQ-5-1: ALl users have a cell phone that can receive text messages. The text message should take no longer then 1 minute to receive this message.

REQ-5-2: The security code will expire in 5 minutes after the message has been sent out. If the code has not been used with-in that time span, the user will need to request a new security code.

REQ-5-3: Users should be able to view a list of all their trusted devices and have an option to remove devices from the list. Users will be notified when a new device has been added or removed. 

### 3.6 User Profiles

#### 3.6.1 Description and Priority
Users of the system will need to make profiles for their accounts. The User profile system will similar to the current Brightspace system that Uvic already has in place. Every profile will consist of a login username and password. They will also need their school email and have an option to add their primary emails to the account. This will help support security of the system as users will have ways to recover their accounts if needed and a space to check all trusted devices tied to the account. Profiles will also have options for profile pictures, a biography and a settings for basic account options. This feature is of **low priority**.  
#### 3.6.2 Functional Requirements
REQ-6-1: All users will need a school email given to them to create an account. This ensures no bots or outside users to use the system. 

REQ-6-2: Users will need to a username and password to gain access to the system. If either are forgotten, there will be a recovery system using the emails given to the account. If the user does not have access to the given email, the school will have to intervene and reset their account for them after they verify the user is the owner of the profile.

### 3.7 User Notifications

#### 3.7.1 Description and Priority
The system will have a notification system that will alert users to due dates, announcements, submission verifications graded work and feedback on submissions. The notifications will be customizable in the user profiles so they only receive the notifications that they choose. There will be an option where users can set when they want to be notified for a specific due date. For examples: "Notify me 1 week before SENG 371 Project 2 is finished". This system will also integrate with the Self adaptation feature. Notifications can also be integrated with calender apps. This feature is of **low priority**.
#### 3.7.2 Functional Requirements
REQ-7-1: The notification system will need access to the users device notification system. Users will need to allow Dimspace to post notifications on their device

REQ-7-2: The system will need to be allowed access to a users calender system

REQ-7-3: The device will need to be connected to internet to receive the notification from Dimspace. If Dimspace notifications have been integrated to a users calender application, they will not need internet to receive the notification


## 4 External Interface Requirements

### 4.1 User Interfaces

The user interface is the primary interface of this system, as it is otherwise quite self-contained.
Students and instructors access the system by way of a web-app, which shows (in the case of students)
all courses that they are registered to and can view, and (in the case of instructors) all courses
that they administer. Users can interact with this in a standard web-app fashion (point with mouse
pointer and click, keyboard, etc), as a later-stage goal this interface should be accessible to users
with a wide variety of ability. In particular, it should play nice with screen readers, and shouldn't
communicate essential information using colour in a way that would cause difficulties for people with
colour blindness.

### 4.2 Hardware Interfaces

Given that this is primarily a software system, hardware details will be left to a cloud service vendor
such as Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure. We only require that the service be performant (as
described in section 5 of this document), which does involve hardware considerations, but those are outside
the scope of this document.

### 4.3 Software Interfaces

The system will interface with a database to durably store information.

### 4.4 Communications Interfaces

The system will be accessible through the Internet, so that students and instructors can view their
courses from anywhere with an Internet connection.

## 5 Other Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance Requirements

The system needs to run at high speeds, 24/7, with low failure rate. Since students need a reliable system, it should be stress tested for 160+ hours a week and a capacity of 2500+ students at one time. System updates must happen without appreciable downtime, to ensure that students' studies will not be adversely affected.

### 5.2 Security Requirements

Account and data security are important as the system will store students' personal and private information (e.g. their names, student numbers, email addresses, and grades). The system will also store copyrighted and otherwise private information created by professors (notes, lectures, and assignments), and students (mainly assignment submissions). The system will integrate with the current security system that UVic already has in place with Brightspace. 

### 5.3 Software Quality Attributes

The system needs to be modifiable and adaptable because this ensures the longevity of the software as it can be evolved and kept up to date with new requirements and features. Scalability is also a key component as the number of students at post-secondary institutions can be large.
