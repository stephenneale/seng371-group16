## (1.0) Product Overview

We the people of “Atlantis” have resurfaced from the depths of the ocean. We have our own currency and bank but need an online banking system to reconnect with the world. The issues we have are the following:

- Unable to e-transfer other banking accounts
- Unable to view avaible funds
- No online payment methods
- The city of Atlantis is growing and visiting the bank is not scalable. Customers having to go to the bank just to view the transaction history is causing problems. 

We predict that making an online banking system will solve these issues and increase customer satisfaction for all their banking needs. 

## (2.0) Project Objectives

The (name of bank) online banking system needs to fulfill the following needs

- All users can view funds and transaction history, including but not limited too: withdrawls, purchases, and deposits. 
- Users can view their credit card information, including but not limited too, credit card number, security code and credit limits.
- Users can create investment and savings accounts
- The sytem should be available 24/7
- The system must be compatible with the Chrome browser as it is the only browser avaible to Atlanteans.
- The system must supports up-to-date security measures

## (3.0) Current System(s)

The (name of bank) has a physcial bank and no online presence.

## (4.0) Intended users of the system

There are two intended users of the sytem
- Bank Managers
- Users of the bank

## (5.0) Known interaction with systems within or outside the client organization

In order to serve our clients effectively, we need to integrate with the existing global banking
systems of Planet Earth. This is so that our clients can fully participate in the global economy.
Concretely, the new banking system should integrate effectively with the SWIFT network.

Additionally, the system should effectively integrate with the Internet so that customers travelling
at home or around the world can access the system wherever they are.
